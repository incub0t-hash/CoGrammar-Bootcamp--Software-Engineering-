    <h1><b><i><u>Who Am I?</u></i></b></h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is <b><i>Lucifer Jones</b></i>. This is website was created using <b><i>HTML5</b></i> to show my
        understanding of HTML and its syntaxes. This website will be very basic as is my understanding of HTML but I
        hope
        moving forward I will be able to create much more complex websites. Below I will create an organised list of
        some of
        my hobbies.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
    <b><i><u>List of Hobbies.</b></i></u>
    </h2>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Gaming</li>
    <li>Drawing/Creative Arts</li>
    <li>Listening to music </li>
    <li>Binging my favourite movies/TV shows</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>
    <b><i><u>How did i create the list?</b></i></u>
    </h3>
    <p>
    The above list was created using the <b><i>"ol"</b></i> tag (<b><i>Organised List</b></i>), I then used the
    <b><i>"li"</b></i> tag (<b><i>List Item</b></i>)to denote each item on the list, there may be a way to do this
    with
    out having to use the <b><i>"li"</b></i> tag before each item. However, as of this current moment in time making
    this
    website, this is the extent of my knowledge which is the whole purpose of this website.
    </p>
